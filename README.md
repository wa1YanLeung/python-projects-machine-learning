# python-projects-machine-learning

I self learned mahcine-learning from YouTube channel [codebasic](https://www.youtube.com/c/codebasics). That channel is pure GOLD. 

After watching the whole machine learning series I understand various ML algorithms for regression and classification, feature engineering, and applications to real life problems. I enjoyed doing the end-to-end projects a lot. Tools used include Python, scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy, TensorFlow, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook, etc.
